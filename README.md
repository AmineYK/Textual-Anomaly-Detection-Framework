# 🧠 Textual Anomaly Detection Framework

## Overview

This repository contains a complete **end-to-end framework** for applying **textual anomaly detection models**.  
It provides all the necessary components to go from raw document datasets to model evaluation, including data preparation, embedding generation, and anomaly detection.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🧩 Textual Anomaly Contamination
Automatically constructs contaminated datasets by selecting one category as *inlier* and introducing anomalies from other categories.

### 🔡 Flexible Embedding Module
Supports multiple text representation methods:
- **TF-IDF**
- **GloVe**
- **FastText**
- **BERT**

### 🤖 Modeling and Evaluation
Easily apply and compare different anomaly detection algorithms on the generated datasets with consistent evaluation metrics.

### 🔁 End-to-End Pipeline
From dataset preparation to results visualization, the framework handles every step of the anomaly detection process.
